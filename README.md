# CNN Demo

This repository provides a simple demonstration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to the MNIST dataset.

## Contents

- **Notebook Demo**  
  A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the CNN implementation and its performance on the MNIST dataset.  
  [Open in Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oYbRdkrgTVKkwxGL3Lxye31pO0UfBh-9/view?usp=sharing)
  *(Source file: `Pytorch MNIST.ipynb`)*

- **Pre-trained Model**  
  `cnn.pth` â€” This file contains the saved parameters of a pre-trained CNN model.

## Notes

- The MNIST dataset is used for handwritten digit classification.
- The pre-trained model (`cnn.pth`) can be loaded to skip training and directly evaluate performance.
- If MNIST data is not available in your Google Colab environment, please run the **second code block** in the notebook to download the dataset before proceeding.
